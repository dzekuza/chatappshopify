# 🧠 chatappshopify — Project Brain

This vault is the **single source of truth** for `chatappshopify`. It documents how the
project is built, why decisions were made, and how to extend it — for both humans
and AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor).

> [!info] What is this project?
> <!-- One paragraph: what chatappshopify is, who it is for, what stage it is at. -->

## 🔌 Obsidian setup

Open this folder (`obsidian/`) as an Obsidian vault. Recommended:

- **Dataview plugin** — query notes (e.g. list all `#wip` pages)
- **Templates core plugin** — point it at the `templates/` folder
